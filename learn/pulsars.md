# Pulsars


## Introduction
---------------

Pulsars are highly magnetised neutron stars thet emit electromagnetic radiation out of its poles, this radiation can be detected when it faces us. Neutron stars are dense, heavy but small stars that have very short rotational periods, which produces precise intervals of pulses.

### Characteristics

#### Details

* **Luminosity:** Roughly 100 million times the brightness of the sun in visible light
* **Size:** Around 20km or less (yes, that small!)
* **Mass:** Pulsars are typically 1.18-1.97 times the mass of the sun, being dense stars themselves

### Types

#### Details

* **Ordinary Pulsars:** The more common pulsar, having an interval of a few seconds to several seconds
* **Millisecond Pulsars:** Usually found in binary systems, these pulsars have intervals of a few milliseconds

### Formation

#### Details

* **Galaxy Mergers:** Quasars are thought to be triggered by the merger of two galaxies, which leads to the formation of a supermassive black hole.
* **Accretion Disks:** Quasars are powered by accretion disks around the black hole, which heat up and emit massive amounts of energy.

### Exploration

#### Missions

* **Hubble Space Telescope:** Has observed quasars in visible and ultraviolet light.
* **Chandra X-ray Observatory:** Has observed quasars in X-ray light.
* **Very Large Array (VLA):** Has observed quasars in radio light.

### Interesting Facts

#### Did you know?

- **Pulsars are precise:** Pulsars are incredibly precise, with some pulsars having periods that are accurate to within one second over tens of millions of years.
- **Pulsars are dense:** Pulsars are incredibly dense, with the density of a sugar cube that weighs as much as a mountain.
- **Pulsars are fast:** The fastest pulsar observed rotates at over 1,700 times per second, making it one of the fastest-spinning objects in the universe.
- **Pulsars are useful:** Pulsars are used as tools for testing theories of gravity, studying the interstellar medium, and even searching for gravitational waves.
