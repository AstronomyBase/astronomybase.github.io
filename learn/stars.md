# Stars


## Introduction
---------------

Stars are massive, luminous balls of gas that are held together by their own gravity. They come in a wide range of sizes and colors, and are powered by nuclear reactions that occur in their cores.

### Characteristics

#### Details

* **Mass:** Stars come in a wide range of masses, from about 0.1 to 100 times the mass of the Sun.
* **Radius:** Stars also come in a wide range of radii, from about 0.1 to 100 times the radius of the Sun.
* **Surface Temperature:** The surface temperature of stars ranges from about 3,000 to 60,000 Kelvin (4,000 to 100,000 degrees Fahrenheit).
* **Luminosity:** Stars come in a wide range of luminosities, from about 0.01 to 100,000 times the luminosity of the Sun.

### Life Cycle

#### Details

* **Protostar:** A star forms from a cloud of gas and dust, collapsing under its own gravity.
* **Main Sequence:** A star fuses hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy in the form of light and heat.
* **Red Giant:** A star exhausts its hydrogen fuel and expands to become a red giant.
* **White Dwarf:** A star sheds its outer layers and becomes a hot, compact white dwarf.
* **Neutron Star or Black Hole:** A star with a mass greater than about 8 times the mass of the Sun collapses into a neutron star or black hole.

### The Sun

#### Brief Overview

* **The Sun is a star:** The Sun is a typical star, and it is similar to many other stars in the universe.
* **The Sun is massive:** The Sun is so massive that it makes up about 99.8% of the mass of our solar system.

### Exploration

#### Missions

* **Kepler Space Telescope:** A spacecraft that observes the light curves of stars to search for exoplanets.
* **Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS):** A spacecraft that observes the light curves of stars to search for exoplanets.
* **Gaia Spacecraft:** A spacecraft that observes the positions and motions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

### Interesting Facts

#### Did you know?

* **There are billions of stars:** The universe contains an estimated 100-400 billion stars.
* **Stars come in different colors:** Stars come in a wide range of colors, including red, orange, yellow, white, and blue.
* **Stars are far away:** The nearest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is about 4.24 light-years away.
* **Stars are ancient:** The oldest stars in the universe are estimated to be about 13.6 billion years old.
