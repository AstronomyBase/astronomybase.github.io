# Supernovae

## Introduction
Supernovae are incredibly powerful explosions that occur when a star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity, leading to a catastrophic explosion that can be seen from millions of light-years away.

## Characteristics
### Details
* **Luminosity:** Roughly 10 billion times the brightness of the sun in visible light
* **Size:** Varies, but can be larger than the entire solar system
* **Mass:** Depends on the star that exploded, but can be several times the mass of the sun

## Types
#### Details
* **Type II Supernovae:** Occur when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses
* **Type Ia Supernovae:** Occur when a white dwarf star accumulates material from a companion star and reaches a critical mass
* **Type Ib/c Supernovae:** Occur when a massive star loses its outer layers and collapses

## Formation
#### Details
* **Massive Stars:** When stars with more than 8 times the mass of the sun run out of fuel, they collapse under their own gravity, leading to a supernova explosion
* **White Dwarf Stars:** When white dwarf stars accumulate material from a companion star, they can reach a critical mass and explode as a supernova

## Exploration
#### Missions
* **Hubble Space Telescope:** Has observed supernovae in visible and ultraviolet light
* **Chandra X-ray Observatory:** Has observed supernovae in X-ray light
* **Spitzer Space Telescope:** Has observed supernovae in infrared light
* **Keck Observatory:** Has observed supernovae in visible and near-infrared light

## Interesting Facts
* **Did you know?**
	+ **Supernovae are rare:** Only a few supernovae occur in the entire universe every century
	+ **Supernovae are powerful:** Supernovae can briefly outshine an entire galaxy
	+ **Supernovae are important:** Supernovae create heavy elements necessary for life and can affect the formation of galaxies
	+ **Supernovae are unpredictable:** Scientists can't predict when and where a supernova will occur, making each discovery exciting and unexpected
