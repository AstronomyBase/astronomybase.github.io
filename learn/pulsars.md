# Pulsars


## Introduction
---------------

Pulsars are highly magnetised neutron stars thet emit electromagnetic radiation out of its poles, this radiation can be detected when it faces us. Neutron stars are dense, heavy but small stars that have very short rotational periods, which produces precise intervals of pulses.

### Characteristics

#### Details

* **Luminosity:** Roughly 100 million times the brightness of the sun in visible light
* **Size:** Around 20km or less (yes, that small!)
* **Mass:** Pulsars are typically 1.18-1.97 times the mass of the sun, being dense stars themselves

### Types

#### Details

* **Ordinary Pulsars:** The more common pulsar, having an interval of a few seconds to several seconds
* **Millisecond Pulsars:** Usually found in binary systems, these pulsars have intervals of a few milliseconds

### Formation

#### Details

* **Unstable Stars** When stars (large ones, like red giants) lose their fuel (hydrogen or heavier elements) they collapse into neutron stars, which is essentially what a pulsar is

### Exploration

#### Missions

* **Parkes Radio Telescope:** Has observed pulsars in radio light.
* **Arecibo Radio Telescope:** Has observed pulsars in radio light.
* **Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope:** Has observed pulsars in gamma-ray light.
* **Chandra X-ray Observatory:** Has observed pulsars in X-ray light.
* **Hubble Space Telescope:** Has observed pulsars in visible and ultraviolet light.

### Interesting Facts

#### Did you know?

- **Pulsars are precise:** Pulsars are incredibly precise, with some pulsars having periods that are accurate to within one second over tens of millions of years.
- **Pulsars are dense:** Pulsars are incredibly dense, with the density of a sugar cube that weighs as much as a mountain.
- **Pulsars are fast:** The fastest pulsar observed rotates at over 1,700 times per second, making it one of the fastest-spinning objects in the universe.
- **Pulsars are useful:** Pulsars are used as tools for testing theories of gravity, studying the interstellar medium, and even searching for gravitational waves.
