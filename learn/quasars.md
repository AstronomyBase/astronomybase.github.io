# Quasars


## Introduction
---------------

Quasars are incredibly luminous objects that are believed to be powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. They are among the brightest objects in the universe, outshining entire galaxies and emitting massive amounts of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

### Characteristics

#### Details

* **Redshift:** Quasars are observed to have high redshift values, indicating that they are very distant and are receding from us at high speeds.
* **Luminosity:** Quasars are incredibly luminous, with some emitting hundreds of times more energy than the entire Milky Way galaxy.
* **Size:** Quasars are relatively small, with sizes ranging from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand light-years.
* **Mass:** Quasars are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes, with masses millions or even billions of times that of the sun.

### Types

#### Details

* **Radio-Loud Quasars:** These quasars are characterized by their strong radio emissions and are thought to be powered by jets of energetic particles.
* **Radio-Quiet Quasars:** These quasars are characterized by their weak radio emissions and are thought to be powered by accretion disks around the black hole.

### Formation

#### Details

* **Galaxy Mergers:** Quasars are thought to be triggered by the merger of two galaxies, which leads to the formation of a supermassive black hole.
* **Accretion Disks:** Quasars are powered by accretion disks around the black hole, which heat up and emit massive amounts of energy.

### Exploration

#### Missions

* **Hubble Space Telescope:** Has observed quasars in visible and ultraviolet light.
* **Chandra X-ray Observatory:** Has observed quasars in X-ray light.
* **Very Large Array (VLA):** Has observed quasars in radio light.

### Interesting Facts

#### Did you know?

* **Quasars are distant:** The most distant quasar observed is over 13 billion light-years away, meaning we see it as it existed just 600 million years after the Big Bang.
* **Quasars are luminous:** The most luminous quasar observed is over 100 times more luminous than the entire Milky Way galaxy.
* **Quasars are rare:** Quasars are relatively rare objects, with only a few hundred known in the entire universe.
* **Quasars are important:** Quasars are important tools for understanding the early universe and the formation of galaxies.
